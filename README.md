# Hi there, I'm Arthur! 👋

I am a 3D Graphics Programmer focused on high-performance C++ systems and the Vulkan API. I build modular frameworks, custom rendering engines, and automation tools for the modern graphics stack.

## Featured Projects

### [Wolf-Engine 2.0](https://github.com/arthur-monteiro/WolfEngine-2.0)
**A modular, high-performance C++ engine framework designed for Vulkan.**
* **Core architecture:** Features a robust **GraphicAPIBroker (RHI)** for hardware abstraction.
* **Advanced tech:** Hardware-accelerated Ray Tracing, Variable Rate Shading, and GPGPU workflows.
* **Cross-platform:** Native support for Windows, Linux (NixOS), and Android.
* **UI:** Integrated UltraLight for HTML/CSS/JS-based interfaces.

### [Wolf-Engine 3D Editor](https://github.com/arthur-monteiro/Wolf-Engine-3D-Editor)
**A comprehensive development environment built on Wolf-Engine 2.0.**
* **Global illumination:** Real-time Voxel-Based Global Illumination (VXGI) for indirect lighting.
* **Streaming:** Dynamic texture streaming and virtual texturing via tile-based slicing.
* **Optimization:** Automated LOD pipeline with vertex color/normal re-computation.
* **Features:** Color grading (.cube support), particle systems, and skeletal animations.

### [The Commit Commissar](https://github.com/arthur-monteiro/The-Commit-Commissar)
